# Business Profile Save Fix

## Issue Fixed

The business profile settings page was not saving updates to business information because:

1. The database schema was missing a `user_metadata` table to store custom settings
2. The form in `BusinessProfileSettings` component had no submission handler
3. There was no integration with Supabase for saving business profiles

## Solution

This fix implements:

1. A new database migration file adding a `user_metadata` table
2. Form handling for the business profile settings
3. Complete integration with Supabase for loading/saving business profiles
4. Updated dashboard header to display business name when in business workspace

## How to Apply

1. **Apply the database migration:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x apply-migration.sh
   ./apply-migration.sh
   ```

   Or run this directly:

   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. **Restart your Vite development server**

3. **Test the business profile functionality:**
   - Go to Settings while in the Business workspace
   - Enter your business details and save
   - Verify that your business name appears in the dashboard header when in business mode

## Technical Details

1. Added a `user_metadata` table to store custom user settings as JSON
2. Created React form handling with validation and loading/saving
3. Added proper TypeScript definitions for the new table
4. Implemented error handling and toast notifications

The business profile data is stored as JSON in the `metadata` column with the key `business_profile`.
